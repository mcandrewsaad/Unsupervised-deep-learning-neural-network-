project:
The MNIST dataset is a very famous dataset used to test and benchmark new deep learning architectures and models. It contains images of handwritten digits (from 0 to 9).
 It consists of a training and test sets of features and labels.
Your first task is to use Keras and develop a model that correctly detects a handwritten digit. Though you can technically solve that task with any type of a supervised model, please use neural networks. 
You are free to experiment with the architecture of the model. Note that this is a multi-class classification task.
Please evaluate your model properly and interpret its performance.
